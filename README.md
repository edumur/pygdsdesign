## Acknowledgment

This library is authored by Etienne Dumur and incorporates significant code from GDSPY, a library written by Lucas H. Gabrielli. For boolean operations, pygdsdesign utilizes Clipper, a library developed by Angus Johnson. Furthermore, the library has been ported from Python 3.8 to 3.11 and beyond by Sacha Wos.
